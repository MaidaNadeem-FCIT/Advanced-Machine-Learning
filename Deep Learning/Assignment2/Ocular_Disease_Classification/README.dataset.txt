 You can discard the Unlabeled images and then apply the image classification on the rest of the images.
 Since there are very images in valid folder. I will recommend to take around 600 images from training set to validation data for training process.

 Finally report the accuracy results for test images using the model you trained.

 The deadline for the assignment is Wednesday, Nov 8, 5:00 pm.
