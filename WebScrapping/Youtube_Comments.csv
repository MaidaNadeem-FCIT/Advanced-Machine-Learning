@afrozasadiq2598,Respect button for Pak bowlers....🇵🇰
@aglove4u1,As a Indian🇮🇳  we also appreciated pak bowling attack... And its very leathal... We also appreciated it in the 90's too..... But to be Frank bowlers have very much advantage over batsman bckz one one mistake n batsman gone but on other side bowler have that advantage n we have loose pace attack as compared to Pakistan bit as a Indian fan looking forward for tye best team effort to outcast pak with collective effort amd from 1992 till 2919 we don't loose agame bcoz of collective effort and bowling done job exceptionally well... Best luck and hope we have good match
@farjanarahman6564,Being a Bangladeshi I would support my country.. I really wanted my team to win this match but never mind Pakistan is my second favourite country.. and babar azam and rizwan is my favourite player  I always pray for them to play a good innings️ I always pray tor them from the bottom of my heart aagar mere team Asia cup nhi jeeta tho I really wish ki Pakistan jeet jay..
@faisalmulla8529,Frankly speaking we can't show this kind of respect to pakistani cricketers here in India like you guys are showing for Virat
@Bisma_artandcraft,"Respect button for Captain Babar Azam 18 wins in the last 22 games, Alhamdulilah"
@hashimbaba5599,"In addition to fakhar, shadab's bowling is also alarming."
@yareman5596,"I don't know why as Kashmiri Pakistani when someone praise Bangladesh I feel very happy 
🇵🇰️🇧🇩"
@reubenfrost6503,"Damn right, brother! No matter how the media portrays us, we appreciate openly even if it is Indian Players and the sand art attests to it. On the other hand, no such gesture is reciprocated from India. India is gradually becoming an extremist state where Pakistan and its people are ""villains."" So, even praising us would be lethal to them and their property."
@K10___,"In IND, we love Pak's Pace bowlers which we don't have, 
1. Wasim Akram.
2. Waqar Younis.
3. And the new trio of the current generation."
@rayyanghani3751,As an Indian Muslim bitter truth is that we spend our whole lives proving our loyalty to India

@umarcheema3535,"Their are serious concerns about 🇵🇰’s spin bowling department. Especially, with upcoming WC in India"
@shreyarao872,"We respect cricketers without considering their religion or nationality. In the India-Pakistan match, we all acknowledge that the Pakistani bowlers delivered an outstanding performance. Not only was I impressed by them, but I believe that all cricket fans were praising them. Even renowned YouTubers in India were lauding their performance. However, as Indians, we were supporting them because we know that in India-Pakistan matches, the outcome is always unpredictable."
@Shaikh__kashif,Brother I am an Indian and I want to say that as a sport lover I really like Babar Azam

@walkwithyash7278,"As an indian all i can say is indian media needed a strong pak team to humble them, and now Pakistan is truly unstoppable, they've turned the clock back to the 90s when Pakistan use to be an unstoppable force, good for world cricket love every bit of seeing their team in action!"

@user-ek9hb4kw8g,Masha Allah great gesture by Pakistani fans for showing love towards Kohli
@SaifAli-vd2ry,Best bowling attack in the world Pakistan
@nooneknows19,"There’s definitely a lot of love for Pakistan cricketers in India. Wasim, waqar,Shoaib ,Imran are adored and respected a lot. The current pace attack is also highly praised in India. I think Babar is pretty well respected. I don’t think people like the kohli comparisons of Babar. But that’s very few people."
@sweetiepie502,Alhumdullillah we have the best pace attack of present era of cricket.Feeling so lucky Mashaallah
@ahmad_adeel,"Naseem Shah is such a great bowler he is unlucky some times but he has always been rewarded at the backend of the innings
